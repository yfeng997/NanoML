In January, Tesla made steep price cuts in China. That move was quickly followed by local players, including XPeng and BYD. The latter trimmed prices for its flagship models in March.\\n\\nNIO, which had resisted cutting prices, saw monthly deliveries in April and May fall to some 6,000 vehicles from more than 10,000 in previous months.
